Sorting Algorithms in Python

This repository contains implementations of several fundamental sorting algorithms in Python. These implementations are intended for learning and demonstration purposes.

Algorithms Included

Quick Sort – Efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm.

Selection Sort – Simple comparison-based algorithm.

Insertion Sort – Builds the sorted array one element at a time.

Bubble Sort – Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements to sort the array.
